# ðŸ§¾ Backend Task â€“ Basic Node.js Server

This project is a simple Node.js HTTP server that returns my **name** and **role** when accessed in the browser.  
It was created as part of a backend assignment.

---

##  Description

The server is built using Node.jsâ€™ built-in `http` module.  
When the server runs, visiting the root URL (`http://localhost:3000`) responds with plain text containing the developerâ€™s name and role.

---

##  Code

```javascript
import http from 'http';
const PORT = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.write('Name: Oreoluwa David Macaulay\nRole: Backend Developer');
  res.end();
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});```
